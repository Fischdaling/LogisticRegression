## Machine Learning Project

This repository contains a machine learning project that classifies Iris species using logistic regression. The code is implemented in Jupyter notebooks and uses the Iris dataset.

## Description

The goal of this project is to build a model that can predict the species of Iris flowers based on their petal and sepal measurements. We use the [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris), which contains four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, along with the corresponding species labels.
